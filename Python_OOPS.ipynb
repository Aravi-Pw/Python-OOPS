        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)+\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. OOP allows for structuring programs using real-world concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP+\n",
        "\n",
        " class in OOP is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data/variables) and methods (functions) that objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Features of a Class:\n",
        "Defines the structure and behavior of objects.\n",
        "Encapsulates data and methods into a single unit.\n",
        "Allows multiple objects to be created with the same structure but different values.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP+\n",
        "\n",
        "n object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with attributes (data) and methods (behavior) defined by its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Characteristics of an Object:\n",
        "Has a state (stores data in attributes).\n",
        "Has behavior (performs actions using methods).\n",
        "Is unique (each object has its own set of values).\n",
        "Interacts with other objects in a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation+\n",
        "\n",
        "bstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), but they serve different purposes. Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class and exposing only the necessary functionalities. It helps reduce complexity by allowing users to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. Abstraction is typically achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, ensuring that only relevant information is accessible while keeping the internal workings hidden.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, encapsulation is the technique of bundling data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit while restricting direct access to some details. It is primarily used for data protection and security, preventing unintended modifications. This is accomplished using private and protected access modifiers, along with getter and setter methods that control how data is accessed or modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python+\n",
        "\n",
        "Dunder methods, short for “double underscore methods”, are special methods in Python that have double underscores (__) before and after their names (e.g., __init__, __str__, __len__). These methods allow objects to interact with built-in Python functions and operators in an object-oriented way. They are also known as magic methods because they enable operator overloading, object initialization, string representation, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent/superclass). This promotes code reusability, reduces redundancy, and enables a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Features of Inheritance:\n",
        "Code Reusability – Instead of rewriting the same code in multiple classes, a child class can use the properties and methods of the parent class.\n",
        "Extensibility – New functionalities can be added to the child class without modifying the parent class.\n",
        "Hierarchy Representation – Objects are structured in a parent-child relationship, making the system more organized.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "Polymorphism is a key concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to be used for different data types, improving flexibility and scalability in code design. The term \"polymorphism\" means \"many forms\", referring to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method in their own way.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that restricts direct access to data within a class and ensures that modifications happen only through controlled methods. This helps in data hiding, security, and modularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "How Encapsulation Is Achieved in Python?\n",
        "Python achieves encapsulation through access modifiers, which define how attributes and methods can be accessed outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Public Members (variable) → Accessible from anywhere.\n",
        "Protected Members (_variable) → Indicated with a single underscore _; meant to be accessed within the class and its subclasses.\n",
        "Private Members (__variable) → Indicated with a double underscore __; can only be accessed within the class using name mangling (_ClassName__variable).\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "A constructor in Python is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize attributes (instance variables) of the class. The constructor method in Python is named __init__() and is defined within a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, class methods and static methods are special types of methods that differ from instance methods. They are used when we want to work with the class itself rather than individual instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Methods\n",
        "A class method is a method that operates on the class level rather than on instance objects. It receives the class (cls) as its first parameter and can modify class variables. It is defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "Static Methods (@staticmethod)\n",
        "A static method is a method that does not operate on instance variables (self) or class variables (cls). It behaves just like a normal function but belongs to a class. It is defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Method Overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters. However, Python does not support traditional method overloading like other languages (such as Java or C++) because Python functions do not have explicit type signatures.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "Method Overriding is a feature in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a subclass (child class) provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass (parent class). The overridden method in the child class must have the same name and parameters as the one in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "The property decorator in Python is used to define a method as a getter, allowing it to be accessed like an attribute without parentheses. It is a way to implement encapsulation by controlling access to class attributes while keeping a clean and readable syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same superclass. It enables a single interface to represent multiple types, making the code more flexible, scalable, and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and is used as a blueprint for other classes. It defines methods that must be implemented by any subclass. Abstract classes are created using the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module from the abc package.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) provides a structured approach to programming by organizing code into objects and classes. It promotes reusability, modularity, and maintainability, making software development more efficient. Below are the key advantages of OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Reusability – Inheritance allows code reuse, reducing redundancy.\n",
        "Encapsulation – Protects data by restricting direct access and using getters/setters.\n",
        "Abstraction – Hides complex implementation details and provides a simple interface.\n",
        "Polymorphism – Enables multiple implementations using the same function/method name.\n",
        "Improved Code Organization – Modular structure makes programs more readable and maintainable.\n",
        "Scalability & Maintainability – New features can be added without modifying existing code.\n",
        "Security – Encapsulation prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n",
        "Multiple Design Patterns – Supports design patterns like Factory, Singleton, and Observer.\n",
        "Real-World Modeling – Maps objects to real-world entities, making development intuitive.\n",
        "Better Debugging & Testing – Code is easier to test and debug due to modularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Variable: A variable shared across all instances of a class.\n",
        "Instance Variable: A variable unique to each object (instance) of a class.\n",
        "Declaration:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Variable: Defined outside methods and usually at the class level.\n",
        "Instance Variable: Defined inside the constructor (__init__) or other instance methods using self.\n",
        "Scope & Access:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Variable: Shared by all instances; changing it affects all instances.\n",
        "Instance Variable: Specific to each object; changing it affects only that object.\n",
        "Modification:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Variable: Modified using ClassName.variable_name or cls.variable_name (inside class methods).\n",
        "Instance Variable: Modified using self.variable_name.\n",
        "Memory Usage:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Variable: Stored once in memory and shared.\n",
        "Instance Variable: Each instance has its own copy, increasing memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This allows a child class to have the properties and behaviors of multiple base classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "__str__ Method\n",
        "Used for a user-friendly (readable) representation of an object.\n",
        "Called when using str(object) or print(object).\n",
        "Meant for end-users and should return a readable string.\n",
        "\n",
        "__repr__ Method\n",
        "Used for a developer-friendly (precise) representation of an object.\n",
        "Called when using repr(object), in an interactive shell, or for debugging.\n",
        "Should return a string that can recreate the object using eval().\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "20.  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent (super) class inside a child class. It plays a crucial role in inheritance by allowing a child class to reuse and extend the behavior of its parent class without directly referring to the parent’s name.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "The __del__ method, also known as the destructor, is a special dunder method in Python that is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when it is no longer in use and garbage collected).\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Both @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define methods that do not operate on an instance of the class, but they have distinct purposes and behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. @staticmethod (Static Method)\n",
        "A static method is a method that belongs to the class but does not have access to the instance (self) or the class (cls). It behaves like a regular function inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Features:\n",
        "Does not take self or cls as its first parameter.\n",
        "Cannot modify instance attributes or class attributes.\n",
        "Used when a method is logically related to the class but does not require class-specific data.\n",
        "\n",
        "(Class Method)\n",
        "A class method takes cls as the first parameter, which refers to the class itself, not an instance. It can modify class-level attributes but not instance attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Features:\n",
        "Takes cls as the first parameter.\n",
        "Can modify class attributes, but not instance attributes.\n",
        "Used when a method needs to work with class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism in Python refers to the ability of different classes to be treated as if they were the same type through a common interface. This is especially useful in inheritance, where a child class can override methods of a parent class, allowing different objects to respond differently to the same method call.\n",
        "\n",
        "Method Overriding – A child class redefines a method from the parent class, providing its own implementation.\n",
        "Common Interface – Different classes can share the same method names, allowing them to be used interchangeably.\n",
        "Dynamic Method Resolution – Python determines at runtime which method to call, based on the object’s actual type.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.  What is method chaining in Python OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "Method chaining is a technique in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement, improving code readability and conciseness. Each method in the chain returns self (the current instance) to allow further method calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. This makes objects callable, meaning you can use object() syntax instead of explicitly calling a method.\n",
        "\n",
        "When an instance of a class has a __call__ method defined, calling the instance (object()) automatically invokes __call__.\n",
        "It allows objects to behave like functions while maintaining object-oriented principles.\n"
